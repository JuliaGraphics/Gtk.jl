# List and Tree Widgets

The `GtkTreeView` is a very powerful widgets for displaying table-like or hierarchical data.
Other than the name might indicate the `GtkTreeView` is used for both lists and trees.

The power of this widget comes with a slightly more complex design that one has to understand when
using the widget. The most important thing is that the widget itself does not store the displayed
data. Instead there are dedicated `GtkListStore` and `GtkTreeStore` containers that will hold the data.
The benefit of this approach is that it is possible to decouple the view from the data:

  * The widget automatically updates when adding, removing or editing data from the store
  * The widget can sort its data without modifications in the store
  * Columns can be reordered and resized
  * Filtering can be used to show only subsets of data

We will in the following introduce both widgets based on small and a more complex example.

## List Store

Lets start with a very simple example: A table with three columns representing
the name, the age and the gender of a person. Each column must have a specific type.
Here, we chose to represent the gender using a boolean value where `true`  represents
female and `false` represents male. We thus initialize the list store using
```julia
ls = GtkListStore(String, Int, Bool)
```
Now we will the store with data
```julia
push!(ls,("Peter",20,false))
push!(ls,("Paul",30,false))
push!(ls,("Mary",25,true))
```
If we want so insert the data at a specific position we can use the insert function
```julia
insert!(ls, 2, ("Susanne", 35, true))
```
You can use `ls` like a matrix like container. Calling `length` and `size` will give you
```julia
julia> length(ls)
4

julia> size(ls)
(4,3)
```
Specific element can be be accessed using
```julia
julia> ls[1,1]
"Peter"
julia> ls[1,1] = "Pete"
"Pete"
```

## List View

Now we actually want to display our data. To this end we create a tree view object
```julia
tv = GtkTreeView(GtkTreeModel(ls))
```
Then we need specific renderers for each of the columns. Usually you will only
need a text renderer, but in our example we want to display the boolean value
using a checkbox.
```julia
rTxt = GtkCellRendererText()
rTog = GtkCellRendererToggle()
```
Finally we create for each column a `TreeViewColumn` object
```julia
c1 = GtkTreeViewColumn("Name", rTxt, Dict([("text",0)]))
c2 = GtkTreeViewColumn("Age", rTxt, Dict([("text",1)]))
c3 = GtkTreeViewColumn("Female", rTog, Dict([("active",2)]))
```
We need to push these column description objects to the tree view
```julia
push!(tv, c1, c2, c3)
```
Then we can display the tree view widget in a window
```julia
win = GtkWindow(tv, "List View")
showall(win)
```
If you prefer that the columns are resizable by the user call
```julia
for c in [c1, c2, c3]
    GAccessor.resizable(c, true)
end
```

## Sorting

We next want to make the tree view sortable
```julia
for (i,c) in enumerate([c1,c2,c3])
  GAccessor.sort_column_id(c,i-1)
end
```
If you now click on one of the column headers, the data will be sorted
with respect to the selected column. You can even make the columns reorderable
```julia
for (i,c) in enumerate([c1, c2, c3])
    GAccessor.reorderable(c, i)
end
```

## Selection

Usually the interesting bit of a list will be the entry being selected. This
is done using an additional `GtkTreeSelection` object that can be retrieved by
```julia
selection = GAccessor.selection(tv)
```
One either have single selection or multiple selections. We toggle this by calling
```julia
selection = GAccessor.mode(selection,Gtk.GConstants.GtkSelectionMode.MULTIPLE)
```
We will stick with single selection for now and want to know the index of the
selected item
```julia
julia> ls[selected(selection),1]
"Pete"
```
Since it can happen that no item has been selected at all, it is a good idea to
put this into an if statement
```julia
if hasselection(selection)
  # do something with selected(selection)
end
```
Sometimes you want to invoke an action of an item is selected. This can be done by
```julia
signal_connect(selection, "changed") do widget
  if hasselection(selection)
    currentIt = selected(selection)

    # now you can to something with the selected item
    println("Name: ", ls[currentIt,1], " Age: ", ls[currentIt,1])
  end
end
```
Another useful signal is "row-activated" that will be triggered by a double click
of the user. Since it involves handling additional arguments, currently you'll need to use the [explicit signal connect](../../../doc/more_signals.md) (see also Issue [#405](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl/issues/405)).

!!! note
    getting multiple selections still not implemented.

## Filtering

A very useful thing is to apply a filter to a list view such that only a subset
of data is shown. We can do this using the `GtkTreeModelFilter` type. It is
as the `GtkListStore` a `GtkTreeModel` and therefore we can assign it to
a tree view. So the idea is to wrap a `GtkListStore` in a `GtkTreeModelFilter` and
assign that to the tree view.

Next question is how to decide which row of the list store should be shown
and which shouldn't. We will do this by adding an additional column to the list
store that is hidden. The column will be of type `Bool` and a value `true` indicates
that the entry is to be shown while `false` indicates the opposite.
We make the filtering based on this column by a call to `GAccessor.visible_column`.
The full example now looks like this:

```julia
using Gtk

ls = GtkListStore(String, Int, Bool, Bool)
push!(ls,("Peter",20,false,true))
push!(ls,("Paul",30,false,true))
push!(ls,("Mary",25,true,true))
insert!(ls, 2, ("Susanne",35,true,true))

rTxt = GtkCellRendererText()
rTog = GtkCellRendererToggle()

c1 = GtkTreeViewColumn("Name", rTxt, Dict([("text",0)]), sort_column_id=0)
c2 = GtkTreeViewColumn("Age", rTxt, Dict([("text",1)]), sort_column_id=1)
c3 = GtkTreeViewColumn("Female", rTog, Dict([("active",2)]), sort_column_id=2)

tmFiltered = GtkTreeModelFilter(ls)
GAccessor.visible_column(tmFiltered,3)
tv = GtkTreeView(GtkTreeModel(tmFiltered))
push!(tv, c1, c2, c3)

selection = GAccessor.selection(tv)

signal_connect(selection, "changed") do widget
  if hasselection(selection)
    currentIt = selected(selection)

    println("Name: ", GtkTreeModel(tmFiltered)[currentIt,1],
            " Age: ", GtkTreeModel(tmFiltered)[currentIt,1])
  end
end

ent = GtkEntry()

signal_connect(ent, "changed") do widget
  searchText = get_gtk_property(ent, :text, String)

  for l=1:length(ls)
    showMe = true

    if length(searchText) > 0
      showMe = showMe && occursin(lowercase(searchText), lowercase(ls[l,1]))
    end

    ls[l,4] = showMe
  end
end

vbox = GtkBox(:v)
push!(vbox,ent,tv)

win = GtkWindow(vbox, "List View with Filter")
showall(win)
```
You can see that we have added a little search bar such that you can see the
filtering in action. It is furthermore important to note that we had to replace
`ls` with `GtkTreeModel(tmFiltered)` in the selection changed callback since
the selection will give an iterator that is only valid in the filtered tree
model.


## Tree Widget

Here is an example of the tree model in action:
```julia
using Gtk

ts = GtkTreeStore(String)
iter1 = push!(ts,("one",))
iter2 = push!(ts,("two",),iter1)
iter3 = push!(ts,("three",),iter2)
tv = GtkTreeView(GtkTreeModel(ts))
r1 = GtkCellRendererText()
c1 = GtkTreeViewColumn("A", r1, Dict([("text",0)]))
push!(tv,c1)
win = GtkWindow(tv, "Tree View")
showall(win)

iter = Gtk.iter_from_index(ts, [1])
ts[iter,1] = "ONE"
```
