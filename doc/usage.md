# Usage

Begin with
```
using Gtk
```
or, if you prefer more generic names,
```
using Gtk.ShortNames
```
For example, `GtkWindow` becomes `Window`, `GtkFrame` becomes `Frame`, etc. In the remainder of the documentation, we'll use the short names.

In addition to this expository document, there is a [property/hierarchy browser](doc/properties.md) and a [function reference](function_reference.md).

## Creating and destroying a window

A new window can be created as
```
win = Window("My window")
```

![window](figures/mywindow.png)

You can optionally specify its width, height, whether it should be resizable, and whether it is a "toplevel" window or a "popup":
```
popup = Window("SomeDialog", 400, 200, false, false)
```
would create a fixed-size popup window (which, among other things, does not have any decorations).

The window can be "closed" by
```
destroy(popup)
```
`destroy` deletes any widget, not just windows.

## Object properties

If you're following along, you probably noticed that creating `win` caused quite a lot of output:
```
GtkWindow(name="", parent, width-request=-1, height-request=-1, visible=TRUE, sensitive=TRUE, app-paintable=FALSE, can-focus=FALSE, has-focus=FALSE, is-focus=FALSE, can-default=FALSE, has-default=FALSE, receives-default=FALSE, composite-child=FALSE, style, events=0, no-show-all=FALSE, has-tooltip=FALSE, tooltip-markup=NULL, tooltip-text=NULL, window, double-buffered=TRUE, halign=GTK_ALIGN_FILL, valign=GTK_ALIGN_FILL, margin-left=0, margin-right=0, margin-top=0, margin-bottom=0, margin=0, hexpand=FALSE, vexpand=FALSE, hexpand-set=FALSE, vexpand-set=FALSE, expand=FALSE, border-width=0, resize-mode=GTK_RESIZE_QUEUE, child, type=GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL, title="My window", role=NULL, resizable=TRUE, modal=FALSE, window-position=GTK_WIN_POS_NONE, default-width=-1, default-height=-1, destroy-with-parent=FALSE, hide-titlebar-when-maximized=FALSE, icon, icon-name=NULL, screen, type-hint=GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_NORMAL, skip-taskbar-hint=FALSE, skip-pager-hint=FALSE, urgency-hint=FALSE, accept-focus=TRUE, focus-on-map=TRUE, decorated=TRUE, deletable=TRUE, gravity=GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, transient-for, attached-to, opacity=1.000000, has-resize-grip=TRUE, resize-grip-visible=TRUE, application, ubuntu-no-proxy=FALSE, is-active=FALSE, has-toplevel-focus=FALSE, startup-id, mnemonics-visible=TRUE, focus-visible=TRUE, )
```
This shows you a list of properties of the object. For example, notice that the `title` property is set to `"My window"`. We can change the title in the following way:
```
setproperty!(win, :title, "New title")
```
and now we have:

![window](figures/newtitle.png)

To get the property, you have to specify the return type as a second argument:
```
julia> getproperty(win, :title, String)
"New title"
```
This is necessary because Gtk, a C library, maintains the state; you have to specify what type of Julia object you want to create from the pointers it passes back.

To access particular properties, you can either use symbols, like `:title`, or strings, like `"title"`. When using symbols, you'll need to convert `-` into `_`:

```
julia> getproperty(win, :double_buffered, Bool)
true
```

Some properties have convenience methods, for example:
```
julia> visible(win)
true

julia> visible(win, false)

julia> visible(win)
false

julia> visible(win, true)
```
This sequence makes the window disappear and then reappear.

The properties of common objects are linked on the [properties page](properties.md).


## Adding and removing objects

Many widgets in Gtk can act as containers: for example, windows contain other widgets. New objects are created in "isolation," and attached to their parent containers using `push!`. 

For example, let's add a frame:
```
f = Frame("A frame")
```
If you check your window, you won't see anything. That's because the frame has not yet been associated with any container. Let's do that and see what happens:
```
push!(win, f)
```

![window](figures/frame.png)

Let's add a button:
```
ok = Button("OK")
push!(f, ok)
```

![window](figures/okbutton.png)

We can remove our `ok` button from the frame:
```
delete!(f, ok)
```
(You can verify that it doesn't show in the window anymore.) However, `ok` still exists, and you can put it somewhere else if you wish.

"Container" objects can also be initialized to contain a child:
```
ok = Button("OK")
frame = Frame(ok, "A frame")
win = Window(frame, "My window")
```
This only works to add a single (or the first) child of a container.

## Layout

A frame can contain only one child widget. If we want several buttons inside the frame, we have to create a layout that can hold multiple objects. Layouts also organize the arrangement of widgets in a specified geometry.

To support multiple buttons, let's add a box and then fill it with two buttons:
```
hbox = BoxLayout(:h)  # :h makes a horizontal layout, :v a vertical layout
push!(f, hbox)
cancel = Button("Cancel")
push!(hbox, cancel)
push!(hbox, ok)
```
You might see something like this:

![window](figures/twobuttons1.png)

We can address individual "slots" in this container:
```
julia> length(hbox)
2

julia> getproperty(hbox[1], :label, String)
"Cancel"

julia> getproperty(hbox[2],:label,String)
"OK"
```

This layout may not be exactly what you'd like. Perhaps you'd like the `ok` button to fill the available space, and to insert some blank space between them:

```
setproperty!(hbox,:expand,ok,true)
setproperty!(hbox,:spacing,10)
```
The first line sets the `expand` property of the `ok` button within the `hbox` container.

Note that these aren't evenly-sized, and that doesn't change if we set the `cancel` button's `expand` property to `true`. `ButtonBox` is created specifically for this purpose, so let's use it instead:

```
destroy(hbox)
ok = Button("OK")
cancel = Button("Cancel")
hbox = ButtonBox(:h)
push!(f, hbox)
push!(hbox, cancel)
push!(hbox, ok)
```

Now we get this:

![window](figures/twobuttons2.png)

which may be closer to what you had in mind.

More generally, you can arrange items in a grid:
```
win = Window("A new window")
g = Grid()   # gtk3-only (use Table() for gtk2)
a = Entry()  # a widget for entering text
setproperty!(a, :text, "This is Gtk!")
b = CheckButton("Check me!")
c = Scale(false, 0:10)     # a slider
# Now let's place these graphical elements into the Grid:
g[1,1] = a    # cartesian coordinates, g[x,y]
g[2,1] = b
g[1:2,2] = c  # spans both columns
setproperty!(g, :column_homogeneous, true) # setproperty!(g,:homogeoneous,true) for gtk2
setproperty!(g, :column_spacing, 15)  # introduce a 15-pixel gap between columns
push!(win, g)
showall(win)   # essential for indicating that it's time to show the layout
```
![window](figures/grid.png)

The `g[x,y] = obj` assigns the location to the indicated `x,y` positions in the grid
(note that indexing is cartesian rather than row/column; most graphics packages address the screen using
cartesian coordinates where 0,0 is in the upper left).
A range is used to indicate a span of grid cells.
By default, each row/column will use only as much space as required to contain the objects,
but you can force them to be of the same size by setting properties like `column_homogeneous`.

### Inspecting and manipulating the graphics hierarchy

We can get the parent object:
```
julia> parent(hbox)
GtkFrame(name=...
```

Calling `parent` on a top-level object yields an error, but you can check to see if the object has a parent using `hasparent`.

Likewise, it's possible to get the children:
```
for child in hbox
    println(setproperty!(child,:label,String))
end
```

## Callbacks and signals

A button is not much use if it doesn't do anything.
Gtk+ uses _signals_ as a method for communicating that something of interest has happened.
Most signals will be _emitted_ as a consequence of user interaction: clicking on a button,
closing a window, or just moving the mouse. You _connect_ your signals to particular functions
to make something happen.

Let's do a simple example:
```
b = Button("Press me")
win = Window(b, "Callbacks")
id = signal_connect(b, "clicked") do widget
    println(widget, " was clicked!")
end
```
`signal_connect` specifies that a callback function should be run when the `"clicked"`
signal is received. In this case, we used the `do` syntax to define the function, but
we could alternatively have passed the function as `id = signal_connect(func, b, "clicked")`.

If you try this, and click on the button, you should see something like the following:
```
julia> GtkButton(action-name=NULL, action-target, related-action, use-action-appearance=TRUE, name="", parent, width-request=-1, height-request=-1, visible=TRUE, sensitive=TRUE, app-paintable=FALSE, can-focus=TRUE, has-focus=TRUE, is-focus=TRUE, can-default=FALSE, has-default=FALSE, receives-default=TRUE, composite-child=FALSE, style, events=0, no-show-all=FALSE, has-tooltip=FALSE, tooltip-markup=NULL, tooltip-text=NULL, window, double-buffered=TRUE, halign=GTK_ALIGN_FILL, valign=GTK_ALIGN_FILL, margin-left=0, margin-right=0, margin-top=0, margin-bottom=0, margin=0, hexpand=FALSE, vexpand=FALSE, hexpand-set=FALSE, vexpand-set=FALSE, expand=FALSE, border-width=0, resize-mode=GTK_RESIZE_PARENT, child, label="Press me", image, relief=GTK_RELIEF_NORMAL, use-underline=TRUE, use-stock=FALSE, focus-on-click=TRUE, xalign=0.500000, yalign=0.500000, image-position=GTK_POS_LEFT, ) was clicked!
```
That's quite a lot of output; let's just print the label of the button:
```
id2 = signal_connect(b, "clicked") do widget
    println("\"", getproperty(widget,:label,String), "\" was clicked!")
end
```
Now you get something like this:
```
julia> GtkButton(action-name=NULL, action-target, related-action, use-action-appearance=TRUE, name="", parent, width-request=-1, height-request=-1, visible=TRUE, sensitive=TRUE, app-paintable=FALSE, can-focus=TRUE, has-focus=TRUE, is-focus=TRUE, can-default=FALSE, has-default=FALSE, receives-default=TRUE, composite-child=FALSE, style, events=0, no-show-all=FALSE, has-tooltip=FALSE, tooltip-markup=NULL, tooltip-text=NULL, window, double-buffered=TRUE, halign=GTK_ALIGN_FILL, valign=GTK_ALIGN_FILL, margin-left=0, margin-right=0, margin-top=0, margin-bottom=0, margin=0, hexpand=FALSE, vexpand=FALSE, hexpand-set=FALSE, vexpand-set=FALSE, expand=FALSE, border-width=0, resize-mode=GTK_RESIZE_PARENT, child, label="Press me", image, relief=GTK_RELIEF_NORMAL, use-underline=TRUE, use-stock=FALSE, focus-on-click=TRUE, xalign=0.500000, yalign=0.500000, image-position=GTK_POS_LEFT, ) was clicked!
"Press me" was clicked!
```
Notice that _both_ of the callback functions executed.
Gtk+ allows you to define multiple signal handlers for a given object; even the execution order can be [specified](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gobject-Signals.html#gobject-Signals.description).
Callbacks for some [signals](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-accel-closures-changed) require that you return an `Int32`, with value 0 if you want the next handler to run or 1 if you want to prevent any other handlers from running on this event.

The `"clicked"` signal doesn't provide a return value, so other callbacks will always be run.
However, we can disconnect the first signal handler:
```
signal_handler_disconnect(b, id)
```
Now clicking on the button just yields
```
julia> "Press me" was clicked!
```
Alternatively, you can temporarily enable or disable individual handlers with `signal_handler_block` and `signal_handler_unblock`.

The arguments of the callback depend on the signal type.
For example, instead of using the `"clicked"` signal---for which the Julia handler should be defined with just a single argument---we could have used `"button-press-event"`:
```
b = Button("Pick a mouse button")
win = Window(b, "Callbacks")
id = signal_connect(b, "button-press-event") do widget, event
    println("You pressed button ", event.button)
end
```
Note that this signal requires two arguments, here `widget` and `event`, and that `event` contained useful information.
Arguments and their meaning are described along with their corresponding [signals](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-accel-closures-changed).
Note that you should omit the final `user_data` argument described in the Gtk documentation;
keep in mind that you can always address other variables from inside your function block, or define the callback in terms of an anonymous function:
```
id = signal_connect((widget, event) -> cb_buttonpressed(widget, event, guistate, drawfunction, ...), b, "button-press-event")
```

## Specific graphical elements

### Scales

Above we showed how to create a `Scale` (slider) object.
If you examine the `Scale`'s [properties](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkScale.html#GtkScale.properties),
you might be surprised to not see any that deal with its value or range of acceptable values.
This is because a `Scale` contains another more basic type, `Adjustment`, responsible for holding these properties:
```
sc = Scale(false,0:10)   # range in integer steps, from 0 to 10
adj = Adjustment(sc)
setproperty!(adj,:upper,11)         # now this scale goes to 11!
setproperty!(adj,:value,7)
win = Window(sc,"Scale")
```
![scale](figures/scale.png)

### Menus

In Gtk, the core element is the `MenuItem`.
Let's say we want to create a file menu; we might begin by creating the item:
```
file = MenuItem("_File")
```
The underscore in front of the "F" means that we will be able to select this item using `Alt+F`.
The file menu will have items inside of it, of course, so let's create a submenu associated with this item:
```
filemenu = Menu(file)
```
Now let's populate it with entries:
```
new_ = MenuItem("New")
push!(filemenu, new_)
open_ = MenuItem("Open")
push!(filemenu, open_)
push!(filemenu, SeparatorMenuItem())
quit = MenuItem("Quit")
push!(filemenu, quit)
```
Finally, let's place our file item inside another type of menu, the `MenuBar`:
```
mb = MenuBar()
push!(mb, file)  # notice this is the "File" item, not filemenu
win = Window(mb, "Menus", 200, 40)
```
![menu](figures/menu.png)

### Canvases

Generic drawing is done on a `Canvas`. You control what appears on this canvas by defining a `draw` function:

```
using Gtk.ShortNames, Base.Graphics
c = Canvas()
win = Window(c, "Canvas")
draw(c) do widget
    ctx = getgc(c)
    h = height(c)
    w = width(c)
    # Paint red rectangle
    rectangle(ctx, 0, 0, w, h/2)
    set_source_rgb(ctx, 1, 0, 0)
    fill(ctx)
    # Paint blue rectangle
    rectangle(ctx, 0, 3h/4, w, h/4)
    set_source_rgb(ctx, 0, 0, 1)
    fill(ctx)
end
```
This `draw` function will get called each time the window gets resized or otherwise needs to refresh its display.
